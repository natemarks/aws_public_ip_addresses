# aws_public_ip_addresses
Amazon AWS publishes the list of public IP block they own organized by their various regions.  For thos of us who want to use that list, it's a bit big to handle manually.  This project is a simple tool for working with it.

Amazon desribes the list here:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-ip-ranges.html


That page has a link to download the JSON file:
